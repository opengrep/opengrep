### Welcome to Opengrep, a fork of SemgrepCS, under the LGPL 2.1 license
This project is a fork of Semgrep, created by Semgrep Inc. Opengrep is not affiliated with or endorsed by Semgrep Inc.

Why Opengrep?

Recently, Semgrep made changes that shifted critical features of its OSS engine and community-contributed rules behind a commercial license. While this was their decision, it left a gap for developers and organizations who believe security should be collaborative, open, and freely available. Enter: Opengrep.

Opengrep is an open-source static code analysis engine built to ensure code security testing remains truly open and accessible to everyone.

With Opengrep, you get:
- A fully open-source static code analysis engine with no hidden features or license constraints. Opengrep is a smart taint-aware pattern matcher licensed under LGPL 2.1. Easily analyze large code bases fast, identify & fix security issues in code.
– Backward compatibility with common JSON and SARIF outputs, making adoption seamless.
– Community-focused development, with contributions reviewed and accepted on merit—not tied to any single company’s commercial goals.
– Your rules won’t be locked into specific vendors, so you can take them easily between your jobs no matter which code security provider they use.
– Long-term stability and future-proofing with plans to transition Opengrep under foundation management.
