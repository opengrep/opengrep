# Since the Fork

**Opengrep** is a fork of Semgrep version 1.100.0. Since the fork, it has introduced a number of new features and bug fixes. This document outlines the most important changes and improvements.

## Summary

### Main New Features

- Switched to **OCaml 5.3.0** with large-scale refactoring to support multicore execution with shared-memory parallelism. At the time of the fork, the project was using **OCaml 4** and parallelism was achieved using a process forking approach, which did not work on Windows.

- Added support for **Windows**.

- Added support for languages that are not available in Semgrep CE: **Apex** and **Elixir**.

### Features

- **Self-contained binaries** for multiple architectures, built using **Nuitka** for fast and self-contained executables. This is a departure from Semgrep, which is typically distributed using python wheels or homebrew. Now user environments do not need to have python installed, and the performance is comparable to the python wheel.

- **Install script** for macOS and Linux.

- **Release binaries signed** with Cosign to ensure authenticity.

- **Metavariable values and fingerprints** are now included in both JSON and SARIF outputs.

- Added support for reporting the **enclosing context** of a match (e.g., class, function, module) in the JSON output. Use the flag: `--output-enclosing-context`

- **Per rule timeouts** that override the `--timeout` CLI parameter. Require `--allow-rule-timeout-control` and also a CLI `--timeout` that is bigger than 0 (which disables timeouts). Set using the `timeout` rule option.

- **Dynamic timeouts** that scale with file size. Enabled via `--dynamic-timeout`, but can also be controlled per rule using `dynamic_timeout: true` together with `--allow-rule-timeout-control`. The behaviour can be finetuned with `--dynamic-timeout-unit-kb` (rule option: `dynamic_timeout_unit_kb`) and `--dynamic-timeout-max-multiplier` (rule option `dynamic_timeout_max_multiplier`); see the CLI man page for details.

- Added a per-rule **limit on the number of reported matches**. Use the rule option: `max-match-per-file`.

- Taint analysis now supports **per-rule timeout configuration**. Use the rule option: `taint-fixpoint-timeout`. (This should be mostly be reserved for cases where results are not very stable on consecutive runs, and should remain relatively low, for example between 0.2 and 2 seconds.)

- **Postprocessing** (autofix and `nosem` annotations) now works with **incremental output**. Use the flag: `--incremental-output-postprocess.`

- Added option to **inline metavariable values** in the `metadata` section of the JSON output. Use the flag: `--inline-metavariables`.

- Support for **custom ignore annotations** (instead of default `nosem` / `nosemgrep`). Use the option: `--opengrep-ignore-pattern=<VAL>.`

- Added a CLI option for specifying a custom **ignore file name**: `--semgrepignore-filename=<VAL>.`

- Improved control over **file inclusion/exclusion**. Use `--force-exclude` to apply `--include` / `--exclude` rules even on explicitly passed file targets instead of just on directories.

- The `test` command now accepts **multiple target files**.

- Multiple **performance** improvements.
